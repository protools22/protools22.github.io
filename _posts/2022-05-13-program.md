### Invited Talk

Please join our invited talk by **Olga Pearce**, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory:

Analyze your multi-experiment, multi-architecture, and multi-tool performance data with Thicket
 
Born of necessity while developing complex multi-physics HPC simulations at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Thicket is the user-facing tool in a suite of performance analysis tools.  HPC users run codes on many architectures --- different CPUs, different GPUs, and we expect more architecture heterogeneity in the future --- and collect metadata using Adiak as well as performance data using LLNL’s Caliper and other measurement tools. Our users needed a programmatic way to analyze the data from these experiments.  In this talk, we describe Thicket, the multi-dimensional performance data analysis tool, and showcase examples and use cases.  We also describe the multi-year process of getting the buy-in of million-line code developers to integrate our performance analysis tool suite, and the leaps in performance engineering that were made as a result.
